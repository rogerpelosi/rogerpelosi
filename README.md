### 👋 Hi there, I'm Roger (they/them) 🦐

🌱 Complex relationalities have helped to shape that which I choose to embody, and have allowed me to flourish thus far. I wish to cultivate my current relationships and open up to new ones, exposing myself and others to more love. This conscious intimacy and vulnerability brings me new perspective every day.

💭 Looking forward, I hope to work with unique individuals in a professional setting, to continue connecting with peers, ultimately gaining invaluable work/life experience and settling into a role within an organization.

📖 Personal achievements I would like to accomplish include publishing a play, displaying my multimedia-multidimensional artwork, and working on digital programs that facilitate community building and outreach.

🧠 Lastly, I intend to continuously observe mindful praxis in all that I do, to further develop my relationships with myself and the worlds around me, thanks for connecting!
